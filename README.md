# Counterdiabatic_AFM
Code for 'Counterdiabatic driving for rapid force spectroscopy without nonequilibrium artifacts'
Each jupyter notebook is a different example, including a Bell's law rate, DHZ rate, catch bond rate and a 3d polymer rate.
The mathematica notebook is for generating the instantanious equilibrium force on the molecule at different pulling speeds.
